# Number sorter

This project is an algorithm visulaliser for number sorting algorithms. Using the pygame python library the numbers are drawn as retangles (depending on values) and the numbers are then sortered with the algorithm processes being drawn to screen aswell. 

Currently the number sorting algorithms are:
    > Bubble sort 

Further algorithms could be added later with little/no changes to the existing class and code infrastructure. 

To install the code dependancies run the following: 
`conda install -n <name> -f req.txt`
